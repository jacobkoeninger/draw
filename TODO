Todo:
  ☐ Store word lists outside of the game logic (Either in an API endpoint or in a module that can be imported)
  ☐ Setup nodemon (live reloading for Node server)
  ☐ Allow users to choose their set of words from a dropdown list
  ☐ Allow users to create a word list of their own
  ☐ End game screen (showing user names and points, as well as being able to start a new game maybe)
  ☐ Connect to a database
  ☐ User accounts (not required to play)
  ☐ Convert React files to Typescript
