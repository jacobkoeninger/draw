  ✔ Setup nodemon (live reloading for Node server) @started(20-03-01 18:27) @done(20-03-01 18:32) @lasted(5m23s)
  ✔ Have artist not be able to type in chat during that round @started(20-03-01 18:37) @done(20-03-01 18:59) @lasted(22m41s)

  ☐ Compress Canvas data (either on the frontend or backend) with something like https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string
  ☐ End round when all users have guessed correctly (timer needs general improvements as well (might be affecting other gamesm, etc))
  ☐ Connect to a database
  ☐ Store word lists outside of the game logic (Either in an API endpoint or in a module that can be imported)
  ☐ Allow users to choose their set of words from a dropdown list
  ☐ Allow users to create a word list of their own
  ☐ End game screen (showing user names and points, as well as being able to start a new game maybe)
  ☐ User accounts (not required to play)
  ☐ Convert React files to Typescript
  ☐ Refactor Game logic to use more efficient sorting methods.
  ☐ Verify that multiple games can play concurrently as intended.
  ☐ Push to a VPS (possibly DO droplet)
